A Chat in [[../Overworld|Overworld]] is any Text, VOIP, Screen Sharing, and other Non-"[[../The Overworld/_index|In-Game]]" communication-based features facilitated between [[Character]]s via [[Rooms]].

Chat functionalities in the Overworld Game can be accessed in serveral locations:
- In the [[Overworld Chat Launcher]]. This is the main chat hub program that can spawn other Chat windows, and launch In-Game [[../The Overworld/_index|Overworld]]s from [[World Room]]s.
- In the [[World Window]], the [[Sub-Room]]s for a given [[World Room]], and the [[World Room]] can be accessed for the current World.
- A seperate window can be popped out from either the Launcher or the World Window for each Chat Room or Sub-Room to facilitate chat within it.
