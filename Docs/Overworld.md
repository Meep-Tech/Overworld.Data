Overworld, or Overworlds is a Social-Focused Chat and 2D Character interaction game. It is similar to Virtual Reality and 3D Chat programs like Second Life, Roblux, VRChat, and NeosVr, but focuses on 2D sprites and animations over 3D modeling. 

Overworld focuses heavily on it's text-based [[Chat/Overview|chat]] functionallity, built with the [[Matrix Protocol]] combined with it's In-Game 2D [[The Overworld/_index|overworlds]] where players can move around with sprite based [[Character]]s and interact with other [[Entity]]s. Overworlds also has a heavy focus on live-editing, and [[Overworld Scripting Language (OWS)|scripting]] as well as [[World]] editing can be done live, in multiplayer if desired.
